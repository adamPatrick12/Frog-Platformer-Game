<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I made created this project back in 2019 for a class assignment that required me to build a game with GameMaker Studio 2. The game had to have a menu screen, multiple levels, sound effects, how-to-play screen, and a complete gameplay loop (a loop that keeps the player in the game no matter what action).

The objective of the game is really simple.

Here's why:
* The player must collect all the fruit found in the level. <img src="README-Images/08d45683-0436-4ab7-b8df-6e3f9d8f3062 copy.png" alt="Fruit" width="30" height="30"> <img src="README-Images/4e204825-3e30-4a53-bb95-da59a8141e6a copy.png" alt="Fruit" width="30" height="30"> <img src="README-Images/5fe9be5c-cccf-45a5-96c1-ded8da673650 copy.png" alt="Fruit" width="30" height="30">
* Avoid all the obstacles    <img src="README-Images/5e93930f-594f-43f9-9766-52c047a40d49 copy.png" alt="Fruit" width="25" height="25">    <img src="README-Images/867b8557-bf1c-4758-ad53-ae89accdccbb copy.png" alt="Fruit" width="20" height="30"> 
* Donâ€™t Die :smile:

Follow these steps and you should be able to beat the game no problem!

## Language: 

GameMaker Language is GameMaker's scripting language. It is an imperative, dynamically typed language commonly likened to JavaScript and C-like languages. The language's default mode of operation on native platforms is via a stack machine; it can also be source-to-source compiled to C++ via LLVM for higher performance.
